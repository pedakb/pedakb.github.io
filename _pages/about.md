I'm a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/).

I am interested in scalability and efficiency of large-scale machine learning models, with a specific interest in Mixture-of-Experts, Federated Learning, and Optimization by bridging theory with practical applications.

Prior to UT, I recieved my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Tehran, Iran.
