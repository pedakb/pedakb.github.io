I am PhD student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/).

I develop large-scale machine learning models and algorithms, aiming for practical yet fundamental solutions to key challenges in learning, inference, and optimization. My work contributes to combining theoretical insights with real-world applications, enhancing the scalability and efficiency of AI/ML models. Particularly, my current research focuses on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Federated Learning (FL), and Large-scale Optimization.

Prior to my PhD I recieved a bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Tehran, Iran.
