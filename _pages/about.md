I’m a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in theoretical and practical aspects of modern machine learning, with a focus on understanding the fundamental principles of designing and training scalable and efficient foundation models.

Currently, I am working on two primary research directions:

- **Efficient Training and Inference for Foundation Models:** Focusing on statistical efficiency and training dynamics of Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures to enhance scalability and performance in large foundation models.

- **Time Series Foundation Models:** Exploring the fundamental limits and methodologies for developing scalable and generalizable models for time series analysis, with an emphasis on enhancing numerical reasoning capabilities.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran. See my [CV](/assets/pdf/pedram_akbarian_cv.pdf) for more details.
